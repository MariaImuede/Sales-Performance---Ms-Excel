## Problem Statement

The sales dashboard project aims to analyze sales performance, identify key trends, and propose recommendations to elevate the sales strategy for the company. Through interactive Excel dashboards, various key performance indicators (KPIs) are examined to gain insights into revenue, sales team performance, customer engagement, and product portfolio.

### Steps followed 


Step 1: The sales data for the specified period is collected and organized into Excel spreadsheets for analysis.

Step 2: Excel dashboard was designed to visually represent the sales performance metrics, including total revenue, sales team size, units sold, customer engagement, orders placed, and product portfolio.

Step 3: Key performance indicators such as total revenue, sales team size, units sold, customer engagement, orders placed, and product portfolio are analyzed to understand the overall sales performance.

Step 4: The performance of different regions is compared in terms of orders placed versus the quantity of products sold. Regions showing interesting dynamics, such as Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas, are identified for further investigation to optimize inventory management.

Step 5: The revenue generated by different regions is analyzed, with Texas, California, Arizona, and New Mexico identified as the top-performing regions. Factors contributing to their performance, such as market demand and sales strategies, are explored.

Step 6: Sales trends for the years 2018 and 2019 are examined to identify fluctuations and patterns in performance. Quarterly data for 2019, particularly the significant decrease in sales observed in Q4, is analyzed to understand the factors contributing to the decline.

# Recommendations:
Investigate the significant drop in sales in Q4 2019 to identify contributing factors and plan strategies for improvement in the following year.

Develop strategies such as promotions, discounts, or incentives to boost sales performance, especially during the last quarter.

Explore opportunities to expand the sales team, particularly in regions with potential growth like California, Arizona, and New Mexico.
